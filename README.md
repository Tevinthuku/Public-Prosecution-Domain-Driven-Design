### Public Prosecution DDD

This repo is a demo of how to work with the Domain Driven Design architecture.

See [link to full statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HpRJj1lk_M80Xvwzs5F-lZ1oACkVNeWRMG0s7BQxZzk/edit) on what I've built.

The repo is based off a live event from Oreilly (Domain-Driven Design: First Steps) by Instructor [Andrew](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw)

The live course was in Java, but I deciided to do it in Typescript.

The Link to the statement on what this software is supposed to do is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HpRJj1lk_M80Xvwzs5F-lZ1oACkVNeWRMG0s7BQxZzk/edit)
